# Python

Welcome to the Python Introduction course on the IT Security education at KEA.

This is an online repository for the curriculum. All slides and materials used will be uploaded on Fronter in your designated class folder. 


## Introductory 
Python is an interpreted language also known as an script language. Python is used on all levels usually referred to as full-stack development. Full stack development is merely a way to say - That it covers all the areas of development, to put it short.

Pythons syntax is different compared to other popular languages like Java or C programming. The example is that Python does not use curly brackets and semicolons the same way as example Java. Look at this below example:

**Java**
```java
if ( a == 10 ) { // do something  }
```
**Python**
```python
if a == 10:
  // do something
 Â // pay attention to the indendation, that is Pythons way to create the scope for the code
```

For this course Python is going to be fantastic for all of you. It will offer a new and rapid way to develop automation.
