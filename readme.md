## Introductory 
Python is an interpreted language also known as an script language. Python is used on all levels usually referred to as full-stack development. Full stack development is merely a way to say - That it covers all the areas of development, to put it short.

Pythons syntax is different compared to other popular languages like Java or C programming. The example is that Python does not use curley brackets and semicolons the same way as example Java. Look at this below example:

´´´
if ( a == 10 ) { // do something  }

if a == 10:
  // do something
  // pay attention to the indendation, that is Pythons way to create the scope for the code
